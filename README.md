# DreamMaoMao's yazi plugins

## Goal

This is a simple mirror for plugins created by DreamMaoMao after the repos were
archived.

This is not intended to be a fork or continuation (for now).

I do not have the git history for these projects. If you have a local clone of
these repositories, please submit an issue here and I will consider a different
way to set this repo up to preserve the commit history better.

### Currently missing

- `bookmarks-persistence.yazi`
- `mime.yazi`
- `keyjump.yazi` (mirror: [mikavilpas/keyjump.yazi](https://github.com/mikavilpas/keyjump.yazi))
- `yazi.nvim` (maintained fork: [mikavilpas/yazi.nvim](https://github.com/mikavilpas/yazi.nvim))
